## Gotta be smart

It's strange. Recently, everything I dream about comes true. The thing about
X200. Then I had a dream about getting some slip I have to pay from the Pension
Service. And sure thing, here it is. Arrived today? Crazy. It's about $1000 to
pay since my last employer hadn't pay anything for 6 months. That too much~
Will try to negotiate. Go there? Call there? We will see.
I need to get my paycheck firt.

Like, for the last three days I've spent $0. Cool. The reaon is that I just have
no money. Well I do but less than $1. Need to figure out the way to get more
money to survive for 2 more weeks. But yeah I've managed to live a month with no
money whatsoever. Last time I got paid was September 29th. I will literally cry
once I got my first paycheck in 3 months.

Fuck being in a situation like that ever again. ### I need more money.

## Flat

I was thinking of a place to move in....summer, I guess? That's insanely long
time staying at N's place. But atm I can't do anything about it.
Anyway, enough bitching.
I love shitamachi and Hokusaidori. Very, very nice area. Cozy, cute, a bit fancy
and most importantly affordable.
First of, I want to live in a high-riser. But maybe not this time lol It's
expensive and the place you get is rather small for the money I will be able to
pay. Nevertheless, if possible, something like 30th~35th floor. A nice view is
mandatory. I sidetracked a bit. So the main problem with Hokusaidori is, it's a
bit far. Not like super far. But good 25 mins to Roppongi, around 30 mins to
Shibuya and 40-45 mins to work. Do-able. But too much? I still consider the spot
and have more than enough time to think.
The other option I consider is Meguro/Naka-Meguro. Very nice area and fancy too.
Obviously, more expensive than Shitamachi. But closer to everything you can
think of: Shibuya -- few mins, Office -- 20 mins, Roppongi -- 25 mins and so on.
Will see. But those are two major candidates. Unless a good deal pops up. 
I think the earliest date of moving out from Saitama is around May or July.
Depends on my job and money. But all in all, I should pay back everything I owe
by that time and also be able to save up ~$5000 for the move. But need some
furniture and the internet. Money for renting a truck etc. The whole nine
yards.

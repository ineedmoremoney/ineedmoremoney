# It's fucking cold

Here's the deal: some cheap rent ($300) and dinner included allows you to exist
while you are living the low-life but fuck living like that for years and years.
I get it if you have lived like that all your life you don't know any better and have
no need to "go back to normal", which would be a nice warm appartment where you can
hang out half-naked on a cold winter day.

## I need more money

Yeah, it's going to be a cold winter. I can't move out from N's house before
May, I'd guess. I just owe so much money. So to be back on track: I need more
money. 
 **Solution?** Work harder so I don't loose my fucking job. I'm a contractor as
of this moment. From May or July I will be able to become a regular full-time
employee. But before that I need to grind on my tasks. I have so much work to
be done. Fucked up. Need to catch-up with that shit. Work harde. Work as hard as
I can.

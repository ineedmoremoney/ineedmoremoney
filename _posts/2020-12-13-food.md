# Food

Man I got addicted to combini food. In all honesty it does taste good and yes it
is convenient. Easy to go just around the corner and buy whatever feel like
eating. 
On one hand, it saves you a shit ton of time. On the other hand, it is not the
healthiest food you can eat. The main problem with it is that there are a lot of
conservants and preservatives in the food. While most of the products there are
not meant to be stored longer than a few months, it has to look good.
Also, buying from conbini is more expensive than cooking at home. Still cheaper
than eating out though. No as tasty of course. There's a downside to everthing
lol
But to note, I did get fat of the food from convenience store. And not in a good
way. Just some flab on my belly. Gotta go to play basketball with the guys once
I can afford it.

# Sports

I do have to move a bit more. I stay at home so much my ass is getting flat by
the hour. At the very least, I shoud do some basic excersizes. Always skip
those. Not good at all. I paid fucking $100 for the dumbbells and haven't used
them for more than a month for sure. Terrible. 
Forget about getting bigger arms haha I just need to get in shape so I don't die
while walking from home to the station.

# Improvements to be done

Hell I spend so much time learning and using Linux and MacOS systems and
utilities I can use in the systems. I just want the best set up and optimize my
workflow as much as possible.
So I will list here the things that have to be done.

Here we go:

- manage my dotfiles with stow and creat a git repo;
- pliguins for vim and tmux;
- check for VPS and a domain;
- styles and layouts for this blog;
- docker proxy with vpn (nordvpn this time);
- docker firewall;
- google chrome browser with Line in it;
- learn more about tensorflow js;
- lua scripts for mac; 
- catch-up on bash scripts;

__Long-term goals:__

- learn the c programming language;
- learn more about functional and reactive programming and how to implement it
  in java;
- learn clojure/lisp;
- get more familiar with vim and read the book on it;
- get more familiar with tmux and upgrade scripting skills;

Something like that. 
I'm sure there is more but I can't remember rn. Should I remember the missed
point, I will write them here with the update date :+1:
Generally, I want to imporve my developing skills and maybe write API's at my
job and test them.

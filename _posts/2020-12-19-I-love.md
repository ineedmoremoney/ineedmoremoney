# I love

I dont't hate it but I don't particulary like it. I mean being trapped in a
relationship with someone on the premise of repiprocity. You like me, I like you
back. That's a nice thing. But doesn't it wears off? We will find out.

I don't particulary hate, but I don't like spending winter in a cold room. Hell
it's awful. It just disables you from doing pretty much anything. It's so
freaking cold in the morining you don't want to get out from the bed where you
lay under two heavy blankets dressed in sweatpants, hoodie, termal shirt, socks
and windbreaker. Sounds awesome, innit?
And the worst is yet to come. The coldest month in Japan is February. Really not
looking forward to it. But who knows. Maybe I will figure out something before
then.

# No, please no

The thing I want the least is to get trapped into something I don't want.
Although, in the end of the day it is entirely my choice. Even if I say I don't
want any drama in my life, sometimes the drama is just a by-product. Take the
good with the bad. Un-necessary drama is not needed and should be avoided at all
costs. But that drama that pops along the way should be dealt with. In the end
of the day it's part of life.
